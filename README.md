# LBANN: Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network Toolkit

The Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network toolkit (LBANN) is an
open-source, HPC-centric, deep learning training framework that is
optimized to compose multiple levels of parallelism.

LBANN provides model-parallel acceleration through domain
decomposition to optimize for strong scaling of network training.  It
also allows for composition of model-parallelism with both data
parallelism and ensemble training methods for training large neural
networks with massive amounts of data.  LBANN is able to advantage of
tightly-coupled accelerators, low-latency high-bandwidth networking,
and high-bandwidth parallel file systems.
